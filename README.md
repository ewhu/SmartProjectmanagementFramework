Smart Project Management Framework
==============================

Streamlining Project Management with Intelligent Automation

The Smart Project Management Framework is a cutting-edge, Python-based solution designed to revolutionize the way projects are planned, executed, and monitored. This comprehensive framework provides a robust set of tools and features to help project managers, team leaders, and stakeholders optimize resource allocation, enhance collaboration, and improve project outcomes.

The framework's primary objective is to bridge the gap between traditional project management methodologies and the rapidly evolving demands of modern projects. By leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics, the Smart Project Management Framework provides real-time insights, automated workflows, and customizable dashboards to ensure projects are delivered on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards.

Key Features
------------

* **Intelligent Task Assignment**: Utilizing machine learning algorithms to assign tasks to team members based on their skills, availability, and performance metrics.
* **Real-time Project Monitoring**: Providing a centralized dashboard for tracking project progress, identifying potential roadblocks, and receiving alerts and notifications.
* **Automated Resource Allocation**: Dynamically allocating resources to tasks and projects based on workload, capacity, and priority.
* **Collaborative Workspaces**: Offering customizable, role-based access to project data, documents, and workflows to facilitate seamless collaboration.
* **Predictive Analytics**: Integrating data analytics and machine learning to forecast project timelines, budget, and resource requirements.

Technology Stack
-------------

* **Backend**: Python 3.9, Flask 2.0, and SQLAlchemy 1.4 for building the RESTful API and database interactions.
* **Frontend**: React 17.0, Redux 4.1, and Material-UI 4.11 for creating the user interface and dashboard components.
* **Database**: PostgreSQL 13.2 for storing project data, workflow metadata, and user information.
* **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn 0.24 and TensorFlow 2.4 for developing and deploying machine learning models.

Installation
------------

To set up the Smart Project Management Framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/SmartProjectmanagementFramework.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure database: Edit `config.py` to specify database credentials and connection details.
4. Initialize database: `flask db init` and `flask db migrate` to create database schema and tables.
5. Start the application: `flask run` to launch the backend API and frontend dashboard.

Configuration
-------------

The framework relies on the following environment variables:

* `DATABASE_URL`: database connection string
* `SECRET_KEY`: secret key for API authentication and authorization
* `JWT_EXPIRATION`: token expiration time for API authentication

Usage
-----

The Smart Project Management Framework exposes a RESTful API for interacting with project data and workflows. API documentation is available at `/api/docs`.
