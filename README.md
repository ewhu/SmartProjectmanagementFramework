# Smart Project Management Framework: Orchestrating Agility

Scalable, microservice-based project orchestration framework leveraging graph databases and event-driven architecture for enhanced agility.

## Detailed Description

The Smart Project Management Framework is an innovative solution designed to streamline project management processes, enabling organizations to respond swiftly to changing requirements and deliver projects efficiently. This framework is built upon a microservice architecture, allowing for flexibility, scalability, and fault tolerance. By harnessing the power of graph databases, the framework provides a robust and efficient way to model complex project relationships, dependencies, and workflows. Additionally, the event-driven architecture enables real-time communication and synchronization between microservices, ensuring seamless collaboration and minimizing latency.

The Smart Project Management Framework is designed to address the limitations of traditional project management tools, which often struggle to keep pace with the rapidly changing needs of modern projects. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and architectural patterns, this framework empowers project teams to respond quickly to changing requirements, optimize resource allocation, and improve overall project outcomes.

Some of the key benefits of the Smart Project Management Framework include:

* Improved project agility and responsiveness to changing requirements
* Enhanced collaboration and communication between project stakeholders
* Increased efficiency and productivity through automated workflows and task orchestration
* Scalability and flexibility to accommodate complex, large-scale projects
* Real-time visibility and insights into project progress and performance

## Key Features

* **API-Based Integration**: Offers API-based integration with external systems and tools, enabling seamless integration with existing project management ecosystems.

## Technology Stack

* **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing the framework.
* **Neo4j**: A graph database used to model complex project relationships, dependencies, and workflows.
* **Apache Kafka**: An event-driven messaging system used to enable real-time communication and synchronization between microservices.
* **Docker**: A containerization platform used to package and deploy microservices.
* **Kubernetes**: An orchestration platform used to manage and scale microservices.
* **Flask**: A lightweight web framework used to build RESTful APIs.

## Installation

To install the Smart Project Management Framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/SmartProjectmanagementFramework.git`
2. Install project dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start the graph database: `docker-compose up -d neo4j`
4. Start the event-driven messaging system: `docker-compose up -d kafka`
5. Start the microservices: `docker-compose up -d`
6. Initialize the database: `python init_db.py`

## Configuration

The Smart Project Management Framework can be configured using environment variables and settings files. The following environment variables are required:

* `NEO4J_URI`: The URI of the Neo4j graph database instance.
* `KAFKA_BROKERS`: The list of Apache Kafka brokers.
* `MICROSERVICE_URLS`: The list of URLs for the microservices.

Additionally, the framework can be configured using a settings file (`settings.py`) that defines various parameters, such as database connections, API endpoints, and logging configurations.

## Usage

The Smart Project Management Framework provides a RESTful API for interacting with the framework. The API is documented using OpenAPI specification and can be accessed at `http://localhost:5000/api/docs`.

Some examples of API usage include:

* Creating a new project: `curl -X POST -H Content-Type: application/json -d '{name: My Project, description: This is my project}' http://localhost:5000/api/projects`
* Retrieving project details: `curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/projects/1`
* Creating a new task: `curl -X POST -H Content-Type: application/json -d '{name: My Task, description: This is my task, project_id: 1}' http://localhost:5000/api/tasks`
